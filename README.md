# poplog-and-prolog-und-lisp

Unfortunately there are a lot of dead links in the world of languages that had their run between 1960-1990.  This Repo will just keep some things in the repo itself so it isn't possible for the links to go dead since nothing that goes in here will get removed without reason.
