# poplog-and-prolog-und-lisp

Unfortunately there are a lot of dead links in the world of languages that had their run between 1960-1990.  This Repo will just keep some things in the repo itself so it isn't possible for the links to go dead since nothing that goes in here will get removed without reason.  Machine learning that can make adjustments on the fly in behavior is something that needs to be revisited ... i.e. ability to learn without using months of expensive compute.  How can we introduce GPU support into an older language that has been on the shelf?  How does the approach change when we can say we have near infinite cheap RAM and disk to throw at the problem.
